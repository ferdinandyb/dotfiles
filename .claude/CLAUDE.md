# shell tools

I prefer ugrep (ug) over grep, and fd-find (fd) over find.

# personal config

I use `yadm` for my dotfiles. There is a README for it at ~/README.md
`yadm` is a drop in replacement for `git` that uses my dotfiles repo.

# nvim mcp

Check the cursor position and visual select in nvim for possibly important context.
