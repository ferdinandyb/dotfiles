# per line. Each line must be tab-delimited, with an email address occurring as
# the first field. Only the email address field is required. The second field,

# them from most to least specific.
#
# You can also match on non-mimetypes, by prefixing with the header to match
# against (non-case-sensitive) and a comma, e.g. subject,text will match a
# subject which contains "text". Use header,~regex to match against a regex.
