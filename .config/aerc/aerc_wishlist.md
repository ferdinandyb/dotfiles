# AERC wishlist

- switch accounts during compose
- preview emails during message list (i.e. preview pane)
- message list: show single line of body like outlook/gmail
- notmuch search: be able to get entire thread (either right away or after with a keybind: -> clever exec might solve it)
- proper image preview via sixels or kitty
- see side pane when messages are opened
- proper handling of message/rfc822 attachments (see: https://lists.sr.ht/~rjarry/aerc-discuss/%3CCMFX6Y1EK9IN.3EDGQCN38PELF%40mashenka%3E)
