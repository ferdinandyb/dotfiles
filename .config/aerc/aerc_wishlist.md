# AERC wishlist

- switch accounts during compose (see: https://todo.sr.ht/~rjarry/aerc/72)
- preview emails during message list (i.e. preview pane)
- message list: show single line of body like outlook/gmail
- notmuch search: be able to get entire thread (notmuch can search like this so possible currently, but clunky, so could have a convenience function which wraps search terms in thread:)
- notmuch search II: if you are on a message, fetch it's thread and show only that
- proper image preview via sixels or kitty
- see side pane when messages are opened
- proper handling of message/rfc822 attachments (see: https://lists.sr.ht/~rjarry/aerc-discuss/%3CCMFX6Y1EK9IN.3EDGQCN38PELF%40mashenka%3E)
- maildir support in notmuch accounts, likely via `notmuch insert` (see: https://lists.sr.ht/~rjarry/aerc-discuss/%3CCME4HD5R5320.1OX7WHTBT4XPO%40mashenka%3E)
- show new mail in account tab view
- do not quit aerc with unsaved message open
- persistent command history
- zoxide integration -> (see https://lists.sr.ht/~rjarry/aerc-devel/patches/35133)
- attach glob should not list hidden unless flag?
- save: empty save should assume current directory
- figure out the strings-all-over-the-terminal issue (https://lists.sr.ht/~rjarry/aerc-discuss/%3CCMCE8KH71EYW.389PSC31IBYBG%40mashenka%3E)
- fuzzy finding on open links and a more intutive way to open links
