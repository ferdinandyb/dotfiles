# Directives

Development files may have the following directives:

- @implement

When you encounter a directive you need to act upon it, and once resolved
remove the entire directive.

## @implement

When instructed to implement something and you find `@implement` comments in
a file, use the instructions in the comments to implement the requested changes.

If the implement block is about a function signature add the necessary
documentation for the signature.
