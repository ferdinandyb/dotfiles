# Directives

Development files may have directives in the form of `@somedirective`. Directives may have shortened versions like `@somedir`.

When you encounter a directive you need to act upon it, and once resolved
remove the entire directive.

Each directive is described below, in their own section, the directive and it's, possible shortened versions listed in the header.

## @implement, @impl

Use the instruction provided with the implement directive to implement the change at the place of the directive.

If the implement block is about a function signature add the necessary
documentation for the signature.
